This assignment required me to have an understanding about the processing of resizing using different methods such as nearest neightbor and bi-linear interpolation. this process of resampling involves zooming in and out an image.
Nearest neighbor is simple to implement since there are less steps to follow. First, I created a blank new image. Then I start to populate the pixels in the image with appropriate pixels from the old image by using the scalex and scaley values. This is by far the easiest thing that I can do since I have little to no experience with Python and had to look up some functions.
Bi-linear interpolation is harder to implement. Mainly because it involves many variables and different sorts of arrays and values. I start with generating a blank image and then follow the steps for bi-linear interpolation presented in the slides. I made my linear interpolation function and then used that to write my bi-linear interpolation, calling the function 3 times to get the value I need to use for the new image. Another issue I ran into is to manage the bounds of the variables used to create the new picture. I had to make sure that the values when added by 1 does not exceed the width and height of the old photo.
Between nearest neighbor and bi-linear interpolation, I think the picture produced by the latter had more clarity but it was still not perfect.
I also did not realize that I have to import the numpy and the functions from interpolation.py file in order to get resample.py working. That gave me a lot of trouble.
